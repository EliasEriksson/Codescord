create a simple socket server
- server should be able to receive data from the client
- the received data should be saved into a tempdir as a file
- the server should then execute the saved file as a python program (with a timeout)
- the server should then save whats sent to stdout and store to file
- send the new file back to the client

containerize the server in a docker image
- https://docs.docker.com/get-started/
- use https://hub.docker.com/_/python as base (simple tag 3.8-buster)

make a client that takes input via discord messages
- parses for ```python
             ```
- send whats within as a file over sockets to the server
- awaits response and messages it back as text to the original message channel
